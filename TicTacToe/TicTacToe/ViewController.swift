         THIS FUNCTION DOES NOT WORK VERY WELL BECAUSE I DID NOT CREATE A LIST OF UIBUTTONS IN MY CODE SO THAT I CAN MANUALLY RESET THE BUTTONS.
         
         WHAT HAPPENS OVER HERE IS THAT THE CONTROLLER KNOWS HOW TO RESET THE MODEL SIDE, BUT IS INCAPABLE OF RESETTING THE VIEW SIDE WITHOUT THE LIST OF BUTTONS.
         
         =======================
                  TO-DO
         =======================
         [1] CREATE A LIST OF UIBUTTONS.
         [2] RESET THE BUTTONS TO THEIR ORIGINAL STYLE.
